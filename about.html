            <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>The DIB Lab is a unique, creative space at Wheeler where students can come to design, innovate, and build. Students have access to a variety of amazing resources from 3D printers to button makers to help them make their dreams into reality.</p>

                <p>The best part about the DIB Lab is that no experience is required! Everyone is welcome, whether they have been making things their whole lives or are just starting out.</p>
            
            <h1>Programs</h1>
                <h2>Project of the Month</h2>
                <p>Not sure where to start? Try the Project of the Month (POM)! Every month, a new POM is announced. Each POM is designed to take between 5 minutes and an hour so even if a student has a tight schedule they can come into the DIB Lab, learn something new, and make something that they are proud of!</p>

                <h2>Robotics</h2>
                <p>The DIB Lab is also home to Wheelerâ€™s robotics programs. Students of all ages participate in the robotics programs, from Lower School students who attend the WOW Robotics enrichment programs to Upper School students in Advanced Robotics Club.</p>

                    <h3>WOW</h3>
                    <p>Lower School students who are enrolled in the WOW Enrichment program meet once a week in the DIB Lab to explore robotics using the LEGO robots. Students learn how to design, build, program, and test their robots.</p>

                    <h3>FIRST Lego League (Middle School Robotics Team)</h3>
                    <p>Students who join the FIRST Lego League (FLL) team compete with other middle school teams to complete the challenges set out by the FIRST program using a LEGO robot of their own design.</p>

                    <h3>FIRST Tech Competition (Upper School Robotics Team)</h3>
                    <p>Students who join the FIRST Tech Competition (FTC) team compete with other high school teams to complete the challenges set out by the FIRST program using a robot of their own design.</p>

                    <h3>Advanced Robotics Club</h3>
                    <p>Advanced Robotics Club is a place for students who are passionate about robotics to come together and make unique robots that solve complex problems. Students in this club work either on their own or in teams and apply for DIB Lab Grants to fund their projects.</p>

                <h2>Design Club</h2>
                <p>Design Club is a meeting place for students who are interested in design. Meetings are a time for students to confer with one another about the projects that they are currently working on and to find people who might be interested in starting a new project with them.</p>

            <h1>Projects and Grants</h1>
                <p>Personal project are highly encouraged in the DIB Lab. From 3D printed drones to a Rubix Cube solver, Wheeler students want to make some really amazing things! Students who are interested in making something can apply for a DIB Lab Grant in order to cover the cost of the materials so that everyone has the opportunity to make something awesome!</p>

            <h1>Classes</h1>
                <p>Classes in the DIB Lab are hands-on and projects based. Students are encouraged to learn by doing, collaborate with each other, and try new things.</p>

                <h2>Upper School Classes</h2>
                <p>The Introduction to Engineering course is an overview of engineering disciplines including civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. Students gain problem solving, collaboration, and project management skills by working in groups to solve real engineering problems.</p>

                <p>In Everyday Physics, students are asked to discover physics principles through experimentation. Once they can explain a given principle, they must complete a project that demonstrates their understanding. Projects include balancing mobiles, predicting where a marble will land when launched, and predicting the velocity of a marble as it moves along a marble roller coaster of their own design.</p>

                <h2>Middle School Classes</h2>
                <p>All 7th and 8th graders spend eight weeks of their Core rotation in the DIB Lab, learning the fundamentals of programming and robotics. Students in 7th grade learn the basics of programming using Python with Turtle, a programming language that allows students to draw with code. 8th graders apply the programming skills learned in the 7th grade to robotics. They learn to program in Arduino which they use to control their very own robot outfitted with a variety of sensors to make it autonomous.</p>

                <p>Every year, Wheeler students compete at the Rhode Island Science Olympiad competition. Students who are interested in competing join the Science Olympiad elective where they prepare for the competition by designing hovercrafts and model airplanes or studying rocks and minerals and forensics.</p>

            <h1>Collaborations</h1>
                <p>Many students also come to the DIB Lab with their regularly scheduled classes for hands-on projects such as creating a working model of an arm, painting circuits, or learning to 3D model.</p>
